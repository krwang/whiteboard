/**
 * We will not be testing the canvas class solely on its own. The only public 
 * method in the Canvas class is the drawLineSegment method, which is dependent
 * on other aspects of the program that will be tested, such as the ToolsPanel, 
 * which makes sure that we're drawing with the correct color and size, and the 
 * Mouse Listener in the whiteboardGUI class, which makes sure that the line segment is drawn in the 
 * correct location
 * 
 * Also, the drawLineSegment method was already given to us as base code, which 
 * means that there is further support of our decision to not test the 
 * drawLineSegment method.
